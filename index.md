# Welcome & an Introdcution to nobody

Hi, I am Chung Yin and I am forced to write something about myself, so here is a quote from *Albert Einstein*:

> Don't trust anyone who cites my name to seek authority 

That quote probably is not from ALbert Einstein, but I pretty sure he would say something similary like

```0x44 6F 6E 27 74 20 74 72 75 73 74 20 61 6E 79 6F 6E 65 20 77 68 6F 20 63 69 74 65 73 20 6D 79 20 6E 61 6D 65 20 74 6F 20 73 65 65 6B 20 61 75 74 68 6F 72 69 74 79 20```

For get about the endianness, it is certain that Albert Einstein is a human computer.

Okey, maybe it is little bit over and is kinda boring now. How about a cooking recipe of [how to make a delicious cake](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvFZjo5PgG0), or maybe you are in a hurry and just want to go to the [**important part**]([#the-end](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvFZjo5PgG0)).
